Fan Shroud for E3D v6 Hotend on Printrbot Simple Metal with Secure Fit Spacer by tonyyoungblood is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike license.

# Summary

Here's a fan shroud for the E3D v6 hotend on a Printrbot Simple Metal printer. It's meant to be used in combination with this E3Dv6 spacer: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:958450  

Because the hot end / spacer combination is shorter than the standard Printrbot hot ends, all other fan shrouds are too long. This fan shroud gets the air right where it needs to be when used in conjunction with the secure fit spacer.  

The holes are self-threading. No nuts required. The screws need to be at least 16mm long for the top two and at least 14mm long for the bottom two. You should have these available in your existing fan shroud or the extra screws that came with the Printrbot.  

Print with support structures. Recommended layer height: .2mm. I included a .2mm brim to counteract warping issues.  

Mount as shown in the pictures.  

Except for the hole spacings, which I pulled from Printrbot's fan shroud, this was designed from scratch. It was partially inspired by Simonwlchan's fan shroud, which is a great choice if you opt for the longer spacer. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:957865
